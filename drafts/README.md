# Hydra Working Drafts

To reduce friction and simplify collaboration, [Hydra's official specification][spec]
will not be kept up to date during development. Instead, the working drafts
in this directory will be used to document decisions, provide examples, etc.

Currently, there exist these drafts:

* [Client interface](client-interface.md): interface of a yet-to-be-built
  reference client library
* [Collection representation](collection-representation.md): representation
  of collections in Hydra
