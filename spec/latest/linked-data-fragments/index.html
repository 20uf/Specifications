      <em>Linked Data</em> is data on the Web
      that can be consumed by automated clients.
      Servers can offer access to such data
      through different standardized and non-standardized interfaces,
      the properties of which profoundly influence
      the characteristics of clients and servers during interactions.
      This document describes <em>Linked Data Fragments</em>,
      a uniform view on all possible interfaces to publish Linked Data.
      This view allows us to analyze the properties of existing interfaces,
      and to define new interfaces with different combinations of properties.
      In addition to defining Linked Data Fragments,
      and servers and clients thereof,
      this document explains how existing interfaces
      fit into this uniform view.

    <section>
      <h3>Interfaces to Linked Data</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>What Linked Data is</h4>
        <p>
          A gigantic amount of digital information exists,
          and new documents are created every day.
          The majority of this can only be consumed by humans,
          because machines cannot fully understand human language yet.
          And even if the document contains machine-readable information,
          often the appropriate context is missing:
          for instance, what does a CSV file with thousands of numbers mean?
        </p>
        <p>
          By publishing Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]],
          we enable automated clients to consume information.
          In practice, this information is available as RDF triples [[rdf11-concepts]],
          which have a <em>subject</em>, <em>predicate</em>, and <em>object</em>.
          For instance, the following triple expresses that Walt Disney is a person:
          <code>
            &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney&gt;
            &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt;
            &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&gt;.
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that each of the three components of this triple are URLs.
          This is the essence of Linked Data:
          if you don't know what
          <code>http://dbpedia.org/&#8203;resource/&#8203;Walt_Disney</code> or
          <code>http://xmlns.com/&#8203;foaf/&#8203;0.1/#Person</code> mean,
          you can look up information about those topics through their URL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linked Data can take many forms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]] allows to express Linked Data in the widely used JSON format.</li>
          <li>Dedicated RDF triple formats such as Turtle [[turtle]] exist.</li>
          <li>RDF triples can be embedded in HTML through RDF-A [[HTML-RDFA]].</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>How Linked Data can be accessed</h4>
        <p>
          The most straightforward way to access Linked Data
          is to follow the URL of a <a href="#linked-data-documents">Linked Data document</a>.
          In other words, we use the HTTP protocol [[RFC2616]]
          to retrieve a <em>representation</em>
          of the <em>resource</em> identified by that URL.
          This process is called <dfn>dereferencing</dfn>.
          For instance, you can copy and paste the URL
          <code><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney" target="_blank">http://dbpedia.org/&#8203;resource/&#8203;Walt_Disney</a></code>
          in your browser, which will lead to an HTML document with triples in RDFa.
          Automated clients might ask for other representations of this resource,
          for instance, in JSON-LD or Turtle.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, such an interface based on Linked Data documents and dereferencing
          has its limitations.
          For example, while the URL
          <code><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person" target="_blank">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person</a></code>
          describes the notion of “a person”,
          it does not give access to a list of all persons.
          This would in fact be impossible:
          the Web server at <code>xmlns.com</code> is not supposed to know
          which resources from <code>dbpedia.org</code> use this type.
          The alternative to scan all documents on <code>dbpedia.org</code>
          and extract this information would be highly impractical.
          Therefore, if we want to retrieve the members of this list efficiently,
          we need another interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          An alternative interface is a <a href="#data-dumps">data dump</a>,
          which is a typically large file that contains all triples from a certain dataset.
          Using a data dump of <code>dbpedia.org</code>,
          we could find the list of all people.
          Unfortunately, this would involve downloading a lot of information,
          even though we are only interested in a small fraction.
          SPARQL endpoints [[RDF-SPARQL-PROTOCOL]] offer an interface
          that allows to select data much more granularly.
          This is more convenient for clients,
          but individual requests are considerably more expensive for servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above indicates that each type of interface to Linked Data
          comes with its own characteristics,
          which can lead to advantages or disadvantages
          in particular situations.

      <h3>Aim, scope, and intended audience</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of <em>Linked Data Fragments</em> is to provide a uniform view
        on all possible interfaces to Linked Data.
        Thereby, we want to provide a framework that can characterize all Linked Data interfaces
        in order to allow qualitative and quantitative comparisons.
        Furthermore, we want to stimulate the development of new kinds of interfaces
        that address the current and emerging needs of the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">Semantic Web</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This documents defines Linked Data Fragments,
        and specifies what clients and servers of Linked Data Fragments are.
        It does not redefine existing interfaces or introduce new ones.
        Instead, it explains how these interfaces can be seen
        from the Linked Data Fragments perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to analyze existing Linked Data interfaces
        or define new interfaces,
        we encourage you to read this document.
        If instead you want to implement one of the discussed interfaces,
        the individual specifications (which are linked from this document) will help you better.

      <h3>Linked Data Fragment</h3>
      <p>
        A <dfn>Linked Data dataset</dfn> [[!void]] is a collection of RDF triples [[!rdf11-concepts]]
        that are published, maintained or aggregated by a single provider.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Linked Data datasets">
        <p>
          All of the following are Linked Data datasets:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads39">DBpedia version 3.9</a></li>

          <li><a href="http://www.freebase.com/">The latest Freebase version</a></li>
        </ul>
      </aside>

      <p>
        A <dfn>Linked Data Fragment</dfn> of a <em>Linked Data dataset</em>
        is the subset of this dataset that matches a specific <em>selector</em>,
        together with optional <em>metadata</em> and optional <em>hypermedia controls</em>
        for these triples and/or the dataset itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any proper or improper subset of a Linked Data dataset,
        regardless of how this subset was created,
        is thus by definition a Linked Data Fragment.
        Larger Linked Data Fragments can be <em>paged</em>.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Linked Data Fragments">
        <p>
          All of the following are (different) Linked Data Fragments of the
          <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads39">DBpedia 3.9</a> dataset:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The triples with <code>dbpedia:Germany</code> as subject.</li>
          <li>The triples with <code>dbpedia:Germany</code> as object.</li>
          <li>
            The triples with <code>dbpedia:Germany</code> as subject or object,
            together with the cardinality of all triples about countries,
            and hyperlinks to fragments about neighbouring countries.
          </li>
          <li>Triples about countries in Asia, with links to documents about these countries.</li>
          <li>The result of a specific SPARQL <code>CONSTRUCT</code> query over DBpedia.</li>
          <li>A dump of the entire DBpedia dataset, with metadata about its size.</li>
        </ul>
      </aside>

      <p>
        A <dfn>selector</dfn> of a Linked Data Fragment
        is a boolean function that decides
        whether or not a certain triple or graph of triples of the corresponding dataset
        is part of that fragment.
        A <dfn>selector type</dfn> is a class of <em>selectors</em>
        with similar characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the general definition of a Linked Data Fragment,
        there are no restrictions on what these selectors should look like.
        They could be triple patterns, basic graph patterns,
        SPARQL queries [[!RDF-SPARQL-QUERY]],
        or even natural language queries.
        Specific selector types help us characterize various kinds of Linked Data Fragments.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Selectors">
        <p>All of the following are selectors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The triple pattern <code>dbpedia:Germany ?p ?o</code>.</li>
          <li>
            The graph pattern
            <code>{ dbpedia:Germany rdf:type ?t. ?t rdfs:subclassOf ?t2. }</code>.
          </li>
          <li>The function <code>f(t) = true</code> <em>(universal selector)</em>.</li>
          <li>The function <code>f(t) = false</code> <em>(empty selector)</em>.</li>
          <li>
            The criterion
            “<code>true</code> if the triple describes a country; <code>false</code> otherwise”.
          </li>
          <li>A specific SPARQL query.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following are examples of selector <em>types</em>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A triple pattern.</li>
          <li>A basic graph pattern.</li>
          <li>A SPARQL query.</li>
        </ul>
      </aside>

      <p>
        <dfn>Metadata</dfn> of a Linked Data Fragment or dataset consists of
        information <em>about</em> the data of that fragment or dataset,
        without being part of the triples in the dataset itself.
        Some Linked Data Fragments might have an empty metadata set.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Metadata">
        <p>
          The following properties could be present as metadata of Linked Data Fragments:
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>The total number of triples in the current Linked Data Fragment.</li>
          <li>The license, author, and publisher of the dataset.</li>
        </ul>
      </aside>

      <p>
        A <dfn>hypermedia control</dfn> is a function that generates an IRI [[!RFC3987]]
        based on zero or more arguments.
        In particular, a <dfn>hyperlink</dfn> is a zero-argument function (i.e., an IRI),
        and a <dfn>hypermedia form</dfn> is a multi-argument function.
        Some Linked Data Fragments might have an empty hypermedia control set.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Hypermedia controls">
        <p>

    <h2>Existing Linked Data Fragments</h2>
    <p>
      Since the goal of Linked Data Fragments
      is to provide a uniform view on Linked Data interfaces on the Web,
      we will describe how existing types of Linked Data interfaces
      fit into the Linked Data Fragments definition.
      As each fragment is characterized by its selector, metadata set and control set,
      we will define interfaces through those aspects.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Data dumps</h3>
      <p>
        A <dfn>data dump</dfn> of a dataset
        can be defined as a Linked Data Fragment with the following characteristics:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>data / selector</dt>
        <dd>
          The selector of a data dump is the universal selector
          <code>f(t) = true</code> for all triples <code>t</code>.
          In other words,
          a data dump is an RDF representation
          of <em>all</em> triples of its dataset.
        </dd>
        <dt>metadata</dt>
        <dd>
          A data dump can contain metadata such as
          the file size of the data dump in a particular representation,
          the author and/or publisher of the dataset,
          and/or licensing information.
        </dd>
        <dt>hypermedia controls</dt>
        <dd>
          A data dump can contain links to other entities,
          either through their URLs (dereferencing)
          or through other means.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Many publishers of Linked Data offer such downloadable data dumps of their datasets.
        They can be used to set up a local triple store.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Data dumps">

          All of the following are data dumps:

    <section>
      <h3>Linked Data documents</h3>
      <p>
        A <dfn>Linked Data document</dfn> of a dataset
        can be defined as a Linked Data Fragment with the following characteristics:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>data / selector</dt>
        <dd>
          The selector of a Linked Data document
          takes a single entity (subject) as argument,
          and it matches triples that are related to this entity.
          <br>
          The precise functional definition of the selector is implementation-specific,
          but it includes those triples that match the triple pattern
          <code>{ &lt;s&gt; ?p ?o. }</code>
          and possibly contains triples matching <code>{ ?o ?p &lt;s&gt;. }</code>,
          with <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> the chosen entity argument.

          The URLs of all entities of the dataset

      <h3>SPARQL query results</h3>
      <p>
        A <dfn>SPARQL query result</dfn> of a dataset
        can be defined as a Linked Data Fragment with the following characteristics:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>data / selector</dt>
        <dd>
          The selector of a SPARQL query result is a SPARQL <code>CONSTRUCT</code> query,
          so the data consists of those triples that result from executing this query.
        </dd>
        <dt>metadata</dt>
        <dd>
          The metadata set is empty.
        </dd>
        <dt>hypermedia controls</dt>
        <dd>
          While most SPARQL result representations do not contain hypermedia controls,
          the SPARQL URL of the endpoint that generates the fragment
          can serve as a URI template [[!RFC6570]] to retrieve other SPARQL query results.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        SPARQL results allow to extract very specific fragments of a dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that only results of <code>CONSTRUCT</code>
        (and thus not <code>SELECT</code> or <code>ASK</code>) SPARQL queries
        are considered Linked Data Fragments.
        This is because only the execution of <code>CONSTRUCT</code> queries
        results in data triples.
        However, the <code>CONSTRUCT</code> query can contain <code>SELECT</code> subqueries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that a SPARQL query result is a Linked Data Fragment
        means that each SPARQL endpoint is, by definition, a Linked Data Fragments server.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="SPARQL query results">
        <p>
          The following is a SPARQL query result:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Turtle representation of the execution on DBpedia 3.8 of
<pre><code>CONSTRUCT {
  ?person rdfs:label ?name; dbpedia-owl:birthPlace ?city.
}
WHERE {
  ?person a foaf:Person;
          rdfs:label ?name; dbpedia-owl:birthPlace ?city.
  ?city dbpedia-owl:country dbpedia:Germany.
}
</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following could be a SPARQL URI template
          to obtain the fragment corresponding to the above query:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>http://dbpedia.org/sparql{?query}</code></li>

      <h3>Triple pattern fragments</h3>
      <p>
        A <dfn>triple pattern fragment</dfn>
        (also known as <dfn>basic Linked Data Fragment</dfn>)
        is a Linked Data Fragment with the following characteristics:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>data / selector</dt>
        <dd>
          The selector of a triple pattern fragment is a triple pattern
          <code>{ ?s ?p ?o. }</code>, in which each of the three components
          can be variable or constant.
          The data consists of those triples that match the triple pattern.
        </dd>
        <dt>metadata</dt>
        <dd>
          The metadata set of a triple pattern fragment contains a triple
          that expresses the estimated total number of matches for the pattern.
          <br>
          Since fragments can be paged,
          this information cannot always be derived from the data itself.
        </dd>
        <dt>hypermedia controls</dt>
        <dd>
          A triple pattern fragment contains hypermedia controls
          that allow to retrieve any other triple pattern fragment of the same dataset.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Triple pattern fragments can be used to browse a dataset
        with more flexibility than Linked Data documents.
        They can also be used to solve more complex queries,
        such as SPARQL queries,
        on the client side.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Triple pattern fragments">
        <p>
          The following is a triple pattern fragment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A Turtle representation of the triples matching
            <code>{ ?s ?p dbpedia:Germany. }</code>,
            together with a triple that represents the total number of matches,
            as well as a form that represents the URI template
            <code>http://example.org/fragments{?s,p,o}</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
